# CSC 4351 Compiler Construction Java

##Prog 1
Use JLex to implement a lexical analyzer for the Tiger language.

##Prog 2
Use CUP to implement a parser for the Tiger language and write semantic actions to produce a parse tree. The specification of the grammar is in the *Tiger Language Reference Manual* in Appendix A.

##Prog 3
Add type checking to compiler. Design a set of visitors which type-checks the program and produces appropiate error messages about mismatching types or undeclared identifiers.
