We think everything should be working fine. We tried Unclosed Comments and Unclosed Strings and printed an error message. 
For comments with did a state and started a comment count. We had another state for escape characters, strings, and ignored strings.
Finally using YYINITIAL we handled all other characters and reserved strings in Tiger.
